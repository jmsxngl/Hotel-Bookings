The hotel booking dataset is used to understand what customer characteristics that is likely to cancel. Furthermore, these features is used for machine learning training in predicting cancelation so hotel owners can mitigate costumers that is likely to cancel. It would be very helpful for the hotel management to have a model that can predict if a guests will cancel and also know what factors made a guest cancels, so they can manage it easier especially in high peak seasons.

The false predicition in this model will have two consequences, the first one is the customer that is predicted to cancel actually came, which will be a disaster due to complaints because the room reserved is already canceled. The other one is when predicted not canceled but the guest actually canceled or did not turn up, which is not very much of a problem because the room can always be reselled for upcoming guests.

As defined, the metric that we will use on predicting the cancelation is using precision to specify our focus on the prediction of cancelation that is 1 (Canceled) and pay more attention towards true positive and false positive.

From exploratory data analysis and feature importance in prediciton model we can recommend hotels the following to mitigate cancelations with promotions, early detection system, extra service and direct offers towards costumers personally.

We can conclude that if we try to approach with prediction model and hotels could filter costumers that might cancel early on, then our model could make hotels avoid a loss of 91% costumers due to the various reasons of cancelations early on. 

Despite the precision score is already good, additional data that hotel management can try to acquire would always be good to enrich the model and upgrade it periodically to get a much more precise prediction.
